# Lens Code releases

Installers for **Lens Code** (formerly Deterministic Coder), the desktop app of the Lens coding agent: it edits the real files in your folder and you watch every change. You sign in with your Lens account; a free account gets a daily allowance of credits, and Lens Pro and Lens Max give you more. Website: https://lenscode.web.app. The `lens` terminal command has its own releases: https://github.com/teminali/lens-releases

Current version: **v0.2.1 (beta, unsigned)**.

### What's new in v0.2.1

- **Code and Work.** Two tabs in the title bar. In Work, a Markdown document or a CSV sheet opens in the same editor panel as code, and the eye icon shows a read-only preview.
- **Settings and Customize pages** next to your files: General and Permissions, and the MCP servers, skills and plugins of the Lens on your computer. Adding a server or plugin only asks; you answer in a separate approval window (Deny, Allow once, Always allow). Full access needs a confirmation and shows a chip while it is on.
- **Title bar, loading screen and preview** reworked: a sidebar toggle (Cmd+B), Back and Forward through files, a one-row preview that can go full screen.
- **Fix:** an MCP server switched off and on again quickly could keep showing as Off.
- **Known limits:** nothing in this release is marked covered by a unit test (every claim is listed under Not covered in the release notes); buying with mobile money was tested on the server side only, not with a real payment; the Windows and Linux installers (and the system window controls they use) are built and launch-checked by CI but were not run by us; a project's own Lens settings are ignored until you run `lens trust` in its folder, and the app does not ask yet.

File names never contain a version number. A platform whose build did not pass the launch check may be missing from a given release.

## Requirements

- macOS 11 or later, Windows 10 or later, or a recent 64-bit Linux desktop (GTK 3).
- A network connection and a Lens account (free; sign in from the Account tab).
- To run a generated app with Run app: Python 3.9 or newer and Node.js with npm. Building and editing need neither.

## First launch (the builds are unsigned)

The builds are not signed with a paid Apple or Microsoft certificate yet, so a file downloaded in a browser gets a warning. A terminal command avoids it: it downloads the same file, checks it against `SHA256SUMS.txt` (and stops on a mismatch), installs it, and replaces an old Deterministic Coder app if there is one.

- macOS / Linux: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teminali/deterministic-coder-releases/main/install.sh | sh`
- Windows (PowerShell): `irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teminali/deterministic-coder-releases/main/install.ps1 | iex`

If you download the file instead:

- macOS: open System Settings > Privacy & Security and choose Open Anyway. If it is reported as damaged: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Lens Code.app"`.
- Windows: SmartScreen, More info, Run anyway.
- Linux: `chmod +x` the AppImage, or `sudo dpkg -i` the deb.

## Verify

Every release has `SHA256SUMS.txt`. Check your file against it before running.
